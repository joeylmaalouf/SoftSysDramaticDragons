        <h1>Project 1: Shell</h1>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, we aimed to create a functional <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php">shell</a>, that would be able to access and use built in linux commands. Our implimentation allows for many of the basic features that a user might expect; these are features such as an interactive terminal mode, a batch file mode, configuration files, and aliases.

          Basic features of the parsing include multiline quotes and comments, commands separated by semicolons, and more. It also, of course, features a customizable prompt.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Most of our reasearch and understanding comes from the <code>bash</code> shell that is used by default in most linux distributions. While trying to identify essential features, we refered to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html">bash reference manual</a> provided by gnu.org. We were also inspired by a number of assignments used at other colleges, such as <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell.pdf">this one</a> from Perdue.
