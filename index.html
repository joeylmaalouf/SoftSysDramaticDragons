        <h1>Project 1: Shell</h1>

        <h3>Joey Maalouf, Apurva Raman, Sean Carter</h3>

        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          For this project, we aimed to create a functional <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_lts0010.php">shell</a> that would be able to run on a Linux system and accept the typical commands. Our implementation allows for many of the basic features that a user might expect, such as an interactive terminal mode, a batch file mode, configuration files, and aliases.
        </p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Most of our research and understanding comes from the bash shell that is used by default in most Linux distributions. While trying to identify essential features, we referred to the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bashref.html">bash reference manual</a> provided by gnu.org. We were also inspired by a number of assignments used at other colleges, such as <a href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/grr/SystemsProgrammingBook/Book/Chapter5-WritingYourOwnShell.pdf">this one</a> from Purdue University and <a href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537-F07/Projects/P1/p1.html">this one</a> from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
        </p>

        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
          Specifically, we designed and implemented a program that would parse user input into tokens and search the filesystem for binaries matching the commands, running them with any supplied arguments and parameters. In between, it does things like check for custom "meta"-cases (like setting an alias or custom prompt), as well as un-alias any custom tokens into their original counterparts. It pulls its input from standard input in interactive mode, or a supplied file (or multiple) in batch mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          Parsing is done character-by-character, which allows for immediate execution upon reading any command-terminating character, but requires us to keep track of some state information. We did this with a struct holding booleans for parsing flags and integers for indices.
        </p>
        <p>
          Execution is relatively simple; after properly parsing the arguments (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/shell.c#L66">shell.c L66</a>) and checking for special cases (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/shell.c#L81">shell.c L81</a>), we fork a new process (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/shell.c#L22">shell.c L22</a>) and execute the given array of strings as a command (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/shell.c#L29">shell.c L29</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          Aliases are created as a set of key-value pairs with the aliases as the keys and the original commands and any additional arguments as  the values (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/alias.c#L11">alias.c L11</a>). For each argument passed into the program, we check for any matching aliases (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/alias.c#L41">alias.c L41</a>) and replace them with their corresponding values. This is a linear search through the alias array, so it would be inefficient for large numbers of aliases, but we do not expect a given user to have enough aliases defined to have a significant impact on the speed. If an alias maps to a value with multiple tokens, additional space is allocated (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/alias.c#L49">alias.c L49</a>), all of the other arguments are shifted over in the array to make room for the additional tokens, and the alias is replaced (<a href="https://github.com/joeylmaalouf/SoftSysDramaticDragons/blob/master/project1/alias.c#L61">alias.c L61</a>).
        </p>
        <p>
          All of the memory for the various arrays and structs is dynamically allocated and freed, with the exception of the initial input buffer. This allows us to minimize wasted space in memory, at the expense of some processing overhead.
        </p>
