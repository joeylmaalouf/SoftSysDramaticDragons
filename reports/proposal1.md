# Project 1 Proposal
### Software Systems
##### Joey, Apurva, Sean

For this project, we want to write our own shell. At minimum, it should be able to read input, either from the user directly or from a given text file, and execute any corresponding program with the right arguments. As a stretch goal, we would like to include bonus features like piping the output from one command to the input of another, or using configuration files to store user-defined aliases.
